Picture this as a neon time instrument rather than a normal clock.

At the center sits a glowing core, pulsing once every second like a reactor heartbeat. That pulse is your time’s metronome, a quiet reminder that even in a futuristic city soaked with rain and light, seconds still march forward with mechanical honesty. The hands radiate from a single, perfectly aligned pivot, each one traced in a different color like three streams of data escaping a processor: purple for hours, cyan for minutes, pink for seconds. The numbers don’t just sit there. They float along the hands like holographic readouts, always facing you, always legible, as if projected by a HUD.

Around it all, the background rains in thin neon streaks, turning the screen into a Blade Runner style loading bay. It feels less like you are checking the time and more like you are monitoring a system. The glassy frame, soft glow, and scanline atmosphere make it look like a console pulled from a cyberpunk control room, something you would expect to see in a hacker’s den or a spaceship cockpit.

Functionally it’s still a clock. Visually, it behaves like a device. A calm, breathing, luminous machine that doesn’t just tell time, it performs it.
